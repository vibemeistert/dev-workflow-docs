## 🏗️ Architecture: Inbox → Archive (Chaos → Order)

```
code-library/                    (eventually main repository)
├── chaos/                       (INBOX - code flows in)
│   ├── developer-roadmap/       (phase-based guides)
│   ├── c_course_github_handoff/ (consolidation examples)
│   └── [17+ active projects]
│
└── order/                       (ARCHIVE - graduated projects)

**Workflow:** Projects mature in chaos, graduate into order with organized structure and clean commit history.

## 🧠 Knowledge Organization (Zettelkasten Principles)

This repository follows Unix epoch millisecond ID organization:

### Epoch ID System
Every guide gets a unique Unix epoch timestamp in milliseconds (since Jan 1, 1970):
- **1704067200000** = Git Workflow (foundation)
- **1704070800000** = Naming Conventions (follows naturally)
- **1704074400000** = Code Library Organization
- And so on, chronologically organized

**Why Unix epoch?**
- ✅ Universally unique across all repos and systems
- ✅ Chronologically sortable
- ✅ Reversible (convert back to readable dates)
- ✅ Machine-friendly (bots can parse easily)
- ✅ Distributed (no central naming authority)

### Atomic & Linked Notes
- Each guide solves **one problem or teaches one concept**
- Guides are self-contained but heavily cross-linked
- Every guide header shows related IDs for easy navigation

### Indexable
See [ZETTELKASTEN-INDEX.md](ZETTELKASTEN-INDEX.md) for complete filing system with all 14+ guides mapped by epoch ID.

**For AI Agents:** Use epoch IDs to navigate. Guides show related IDs in headers; follow them to discover connections. The index provides a complete map of all content.

## 📌 Purpose & Philosophy

**Purpose:** Reusable workflow documentation evolved from real consolidation work:
- 681,662 code files organized by language and domain
- 66 git repositories unified under coherent structure
- Multiple learning platforms (freeCodeCamp, SMC, MIT) integrated into single library

**Philosophy:**
- Language-grouped repos for polyglot portfolios
- One repo per course with projects as subdirectories
- Commit per milestone (test passed, feature complete)
- Push before context switch to preserve work
- kebab-case for repos, snake_case for C, camelCase for JS/Python
- Dedup before organize to start with clean foundation
- DRY principle: One .gitignore for entire workspace hierarchy

---

## 🔍 Use Cases

**For AI Coding Agents:** Reference these docs when working in any codebase to maintain consistency.

**For Portfolio Development:** Apply these patterns when organizing scattered learning projects into GitHub-ready repositories.

**For Code Consolidation:** Follow the roadmap when merging duplicates, course materials, and archived code into unified structures.

---

## 📊 Repository Stats

- **Files:** 14 comprehensive guides
- **Scope:** C, Python, JavaScript, Bash, and polyglot strategies
- **Time Investment:** ~100 hours of consolidation + documentation
- **Coverage:** Setup, workflow, consolidation, course-specific, reference materials
