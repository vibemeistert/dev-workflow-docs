## THREE NEW GUIDES CREATED

### 1. 1704117600000-MASTER-RESEARCH-SYNTHESIS.md
**Length:** ~1500 lines | **Read Time:** 30 min (skim) / 2 hours (deep)

**What It Contains:**
- Git mastery (Linux kernel practices, 30+ years)
- K&R coding standards (exact formatting rules)
- C project structure levels (Level 1-5, when to use each)
- Zettelkasten principles (Niklas Luhmann's system)
- GTD workflow (David Allen's five-step method)
- BuJo daily execution (bullet journal tactics)
- Synthesis showing how all systems connect

**Why This Matters:**
This is the FOUNDATIONAL KNOWLEDGE synthesized from:
- Linux kernel 20+ years of practice
- GNU standards (gcc, binutils, glibc)
- Niklas Luhmann's 90,000-card system
- David Allen's GTD methodology (25 years proven)
- Your own WfK documentation

**When to Reference:**
- Need historical context for why a practice exists?
- Want to understand the full system?
- Setting up your personal knowledge management?
- Writing formal documentation?

**Key Sections:**
```
PART 1: Git Mastery & Repository Architecture (220 lines)
PART 2: K&R Coding Standards (250 lines) ← USE THIS WHILE CODING

### 2. 1704118200000-RECOVERY-BLUEPRINT-FINAL-EXAM.md
**Length:** ~600 lines | **Read Time:** 15 min (skim) / 45 min (deep)

**What It Contains:**
- Exactly what professional structure you lost
- Why `src/`, `include/`, `bin/`, `obj/` matter
- Problems 20, 19, 18 as exemplars of what was professional
- Current broken state (diagnostic)
- Phase-by-phase restoration strategy
- Template structures for Level 1, 2, 3 problems
- Prevention guide (never lose it again)

**Why This Matters:**
This is your SPECIFIC SOLUTION to the problem you described:
> "you are missing so many bins, buckets and folders, and also the notes about how to split things into headers and imps"

Directly addresses:
- "bins" = `bin/` directory
- "buckets" = `obj/` directory
- "folders" = `src/` and `include/` directories
- "notes about splitting" = header/implementation separation

**When to Reference:**
- Creating folder structure for any problem
- Need exact Makefile for multi-file project?
- Unsure which structure level for Problem X?
- Want step-by-step instructions?

**You'll Use This Like:**
```
Need structure for Problem 019?
→ Open RECOVERY BLUEPRINT
→ Find "Level 2 Template"
→ Copy src/, include/, bin/, obj/ structure
→ Copy Makefile for multi-file
→ Create README.md
→ Commit: "refactor: restore professional structure"
```

- Need a confidence boost (see what you now have)?
- Want to structure your week?
- Need success metrics to track?

**You'll Use This Like:**
```
"What should I do right now?"

## RELATIONSHIP TO YOUR EXISTING GUIDES

### The Three New Guides BUILD ON Your 14 WfK Guides:

```
Your 14 WfK Guides (Atomic, Standalone)
  ↓ synthesized into
1704117600000-MASTER-RESEARCH-SYNTHESIS (Comprehensive knowledge)
  ↓ applied specifically to
1704118200000-RECOVERY-BLUEPRINT-FINAL-EXAM (Your situation)
  ↓ executed via
1704118800000-YOUR-PERSONALIZED-ROADMAP (Your actions)
```

**Example Cross-Reference:**

You want to know about K&R standards:

1. **Quick question:** "What's the braces placement rule?"
   → 1704070800000-NAMING-CONVENTIONS (quick reference)

2. **Detailed question:** "Why do K&R standards exist?"
   → 1704117600000-MASTER-RESEARCH-SYNTHESIS Part 2 (foundation)

3. **Implementation:** "Show me exact code examples"
   → 1704117600000-MASTER-RESEARCH-SYNTHESIS Part 2 (has code samples)

4. **Action:** "Code my Problem 001 in K&R style"
   → 1704118800000-YOUR-PERSONALIZED-ROADMAP (execution guidance)
