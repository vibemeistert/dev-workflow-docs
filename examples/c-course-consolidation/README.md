# C Course Consolidation Example

This is a **real example** of consolidating an 8-week C programming course into a GitHub repository.

## What This Example Shows

1. **Complete extraction** - 270 source files + 42 PDFs + Canvas course data
2. **JSON structure** - How to organize course data for AI processing
3. **Handoff package** - Complete instructions for repository setup
4. **Git strategy** - Commit history reconstruction from timestamps
5. **Discovery process** - How duplicates, iterations, and mislabeled files were identified

## Files in This Example

- `c_course_unified.json` (495KB) - **Single source of truth** with everything
- `HANDOFF_TO_GITHUB_AGENT.md` - Complete setup instructions
- `c_class_extracted.json` - Local source code backup
- `canvas_course_extracted.json` - Canvas LMS export
- `c_course_session_log.json` - Commands and discoveries
- `50_csc_complete_file_map.txt` - All 270 file paths
- `pdf_submission_map.json` - PDF locations

## Use This Template For

- Consolidating other courses (Python, Java, etc.)
- Organizing scattered learning projects
- Extracting data from learning management systems
- Building portfolio repositories with proper structure
